Famicam-Facelogger!

Need to stalk people at the lab but don't have all day to dedicate to the famduino channel for nefarious purpose's?
Wouldn't it be great if there was some automated tool that allowed you to track who goes to the lab and when 
you need to stir up some shit?

WELL NOW YOU CAN!

INTRODUCING

THE FAMICAM FACELOGGER!!

This handy little bot's goal is to grab the latest jpg file url from the familab slack, perform 
image processing to extrapolate and recognizes the faces of anyone in the image and then log the time and individuals found
to a database for further analysis!

All your big brother needs are freely provided open source just because I was bored and needed a weekend project!

Have fun kids!
